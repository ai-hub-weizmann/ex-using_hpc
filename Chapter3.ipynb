    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line tells the system to use bash when executing the code. It is often redundant, but it is nevertheless good practice.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two ways of running a bash script - either by calling the `bash` command or by making the script executable.\n",
    "* **Calling the `bash` command** is as simple as writing `bash <path to script>` in the terminal.\n",
    "* **Making the script executable** requires first changing the permissions of the script before running the script by itself without calling the `bash` command. Adding execution permissions is done by `chmod +x <path to script>`. After this the script can be run by calling `./<path_to_script>`. The `./` is required because otherwise the OS will try looking for \"installed\" programs with the same name as the script, and might get return a `command not found: <scriptname>` error if it doesn't find one."

    "## Variables, arithmetics, and comments\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "We can define a variable by typing `vairable_name=value`.\n",
    "Notice that, unlike in python, no spaces are allowed arround the `=`.\n",
    "The value of the variable can be accessed by adding a `$` before the variable name.\n",
    "For example, running the following script:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "greeting=Welcome\n",
    "name=Programmer\n",
    "echo $greeting $name!\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print `Welcome Programmer!` to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable can contain an array of elements as well. In this case, all the elements should be enclosed by parenthesis and separated by white spaces. A specific element of the array can be accessed by its index. Indexing in bash is 1-based, and it can be acces from the beginnign with positive number or from the end with negative numbers. \n",
    "You can reassign values to array elements by the `array[idx]=new_value`.\n",
    "Getting the value of an array element inside another operation (such as `echo`) requires evaluation, so it has to be wrapped by `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, running the following script:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "greeting=Welcome\n",
    "names=(Programmer, Analyst, Scientist)\n",
    "echo ${names[*]}, 'is everybody here?'\n",
    "echo $greeting ${names[3]}!\n",
    "names[-1]=Me\n",
    "echo $greeting ${names[-1]}...\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print to the screen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Programmer, Analyst, Scientist, is everybody here?\n",
    "Welcome Scientist!\n",
    "Welcome Me...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can evaluate commands into a variable with the syntax `var=$(command)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetics\n",
    "You can do arithmetics in bash with numbers, or with variables that contain only numbers. Though technically it is possible to do calculations with decimal numbers, it is slightly more complicated than we would like so we will stick with integers only.\n",
    "The supported arithmetic operations are `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `^` (exponentiation), `/` (division), and `%` (modulus).\n",
    "All arithmetic operations **require** a blank space before and after the operation symbol.\n",
    "Evaluating arithmetic expressions is done inside souble parentheses with a `$` sign, and can be assigned to a variable:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "var=$((expression))\n",
    "'''\n",
    "For example, running the following script:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "name=Programmer\n",
    "old_experience=3\n",
    "new_experience=$(($old_experience + 1))\n",
    "echo Congratulations $name!\n",
    "echo 'You had ' $old_experience 'years of experience.'\n",
    "echo 'Now you have ' $new_experience 'years of experience.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print to the screen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Congratulations Programmer!\n",
    "You had  3 years of experience.\n",
    "Now you have  4 years of experience.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "From time to time you will need to comment your scripts. This will be usefull for adding helpful information that shouldn't be executed, as well as for testing and debugging your scripts.\n",
    "Adding comments in bash is extremely simple - you add a `#` mark before the text you would like to comment. This will make all the text after the `#` and before the next new-line invisible to the system when running the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, running the following script:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "name=Programmer\n",
    "old_experience=3\n",
    "new_experience=$(($old_experience + 1))\n",
    "echo Congratulations # $name!\n",
    "echo 'You had ' $old_experience 'years of experience.'\n",
    "# echo 'Now you have ' $new_experience 'years of experience.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print to the screen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Congratulations\n",
    "You had  3 years of experience.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*note* that the `#` mark is not a comment when directly followed by `!` at the beginning of the script."

    "## loops, logical operations and if statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops\n",
    "There are two types of loops in bash: `for` and `while`. In this tutorial we will focus only on `for` loops. In case you are interested or need a `while` [this page](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/bash-scripting-while-loops) has a good and comprehensive overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop iterates over a list and performs an action for every element of the list. The action can utilize the list element, or disregard it completely.\n",
    "The basic syntax of the `for` loop is:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "for el in list\n",
    "do\n",
    "    commands\n",
    "done\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The operations performed in every iterations are the ones enclosed between the `do` and `done`.\n",
    "The indentations can (and should) be added for code readability, but have no impact on the skript itself.\n",
    "The list can be defined in-place, or read from a variable. In case you define it in-place, the list **should not** be enclosed by parenteses. Adding the parenteses will result in an error like `syntax error near unexpected token '('`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, running the following script:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "greeting=Welcome\n",
    "for name in Programmer, Analyst, Scientist\n",
    "do\n",
    "    echo $greeting $name!\n",
    "done    \n",
    "```\n",
    "will print to the screen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Welcome Programmer!\n",
    "Welcome Analyst!\n",
    "Welcome Scientist!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The list could also be previously defined as a variable. In this case all the elements of the list have to be evaluated, so the following syntax is required:\n",
    "```\n",
    "list=(el1 el2 el3)\n",
    "for el in ${list[*]}\n",
    "do\n",
    "    commands\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical operations\n",
    "A logical operation compares two numbers and returns a vlue of `true` or `false`. These operations come between two numbers and compare the left number with the right number, with general syntax of `num1 -<logical operation> num2`.\n",
    "The available operations are: `-eq` (equality), `-ne` (not equal), `-gt` (greater than), `-ge` (greater or equal), `-lt` (less than), `-le` (less or equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "### if statements\n",
    "`if` statements determine the flow of the code. These statements are followed by a condition. If the condition is true some code is executed while if it is not true some other code gets executed.\n",
    "the general staement of these statements in bash is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if [ conditions ]\n",
    "    then\n",
    "        commands\n",
    "elif [ conditions ]; then\n",
    "        commands\n",
    "else\n",
    "    default commands\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "Every `if` or `elif` has to be followed by a `then`. \n",
    "The square brackets, as well as the spaces between them and the conditions, are required for the `if` statement to evaluate correctly!\n",
    "Between these keywords can come either a newline, a semicolon `;` or both. \n",
    "`elif` commands get evaluated only when the `if` before it is false. \n",
    "As many `elif`s as necessary can be added.\n",
    "The default behavior (if required) should come after the `else` command. This command does **not** require a `then`.\n",
    "The whole `if` statement has to be closed by a `fi`.\n",
    "Indentation plays no role in bash. It can (and should) be added for readability, but that's it.\n",
    "`if` statements can be nested to further direct the behavior of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "*note* boolean operations can be added to the conditions, but we will not covere these in this tutorial. Any boolean operation can be achieved also with a nested if and logical operations.\n"
